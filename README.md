# Analyzing Crime Rates in Uzbekistan: A Demographic Perspective

This project's goal is to analyze the dynamics of crime rates in Uzbekistan by integrating crime statistics with demographic data, including population density and income levels.

We aim to identify potential correlations and causalities between these variables.
