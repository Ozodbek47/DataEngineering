## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing Crime Rates in Uzbekistan: A Demographic Perspective

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do the factors of Population Density and Income Levels affect the Crime Rates in Uzbekistan?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The primary goal of the project is to address the issue of rising crime rates in Uzbekistan, which is a major concern for the country's inhabitants and authorities. Crime rates have an impact on the population's safety and well-being, and knowing the underlying issues is critical for making informedÂ decisions.

This research takes a data-driven approach, employing Multiple Regression Analysis, which integrates crime statistics with demographic data, such as population density and income levels. The purpose is to look at potential correlations and dependencies between these variables.
